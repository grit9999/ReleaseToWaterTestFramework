Below is comments on improvements I would have had made if I had more time.

1. The test written for the technical test assignment is in ApplicationSpecs/Tests folder of the solution.

2. Used specflow and BDD to define the feature and feature step files for the tests.

3. Create a application spec class library project to contain all the application related code, eg. page objects, testdata, tests, feature files. 

4. Create a spec framework class library project to contain all the framework code that application can use for the testing
	eg. browser driver methods, page extension methods, assertion methods.

5. Use json files for holding the test data.

6. Add some ability to make screenshots when errors occur.
